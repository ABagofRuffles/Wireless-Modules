% Using Matlab, simulate the BER performance for QPSK signals. 
% Geometric representations should be used. 
% Plot the simulated BER together with the theoretical result. 
% The evaluated values of Eb/N0 should be 0, 1, ?, 10 dB. 
% Sufficiently high number of random bits should be used to ensure 
% high accuracy of the simulated BER. 
% Submit your waveforms with a separate Matlab code.
